Filter Paginated Indexes using the CakePHP Filter Plugin

## Background
This plugin is a fork of Jose Gonzalez's Filter component(http://github.com/josegonzalez/cakephp-filter-component), which is something of a fork of James Fairhurst's Filter Component (http://www.jamesfairhurst.co.uk/posts/view/cakephp_filter_component/), which is in turn a fork by Maciej Grajcarek (http://blog.uplevel.pl/index.php/2008/06/cakephp-12-filter-component/) which is ITSELF a fork from Nik Chankov's code at http://nik.chankov.net/2008/03/01/filtering-component-for-your-tables/ .

That's a lot of forks...

This also contains a view helper made by 'mcurry' (http://github.com/mcurry/cakephp-filter-component).

This also uses a behavior adapted from work by 'Brenton' (http://bakery.cakephp.org/articles/view/habtm-searching) to allow for HasAndBelongsToMany and HasMany relationships.

This works for all relationships.

## Installation
- Clone from github : in your plugin directory type `git clone  git://github.com/JeffreyMarvin/cakephp-filter-plugin.git`
- Add as a git submodule : in your plugin directory type `git submodule add git://github.com/JeffreyMarvin/cakephp-filter-plugin.git`
- Download an archive from github and extract it in `/plugins/filter`

## Usage
1. Include the component in your controller (AppController or otherwise)
	var $components = array('Filter.Filter');
2. Use something like the following in your index
	function index() {
		$filterOptions = $this->Filter->filterOptions;
		$posts = $this->paginate(null, $this->Filter->filter);
		$this->set(compact('filterOptions', 'posts'));
	}
3. Setup your view correctly:

-Option 1: Helper

Use the helper In between the row with all the column headers and the first row of data add: 
	<?php echo $filter->form('Post', array('name')) ?>  
The first parameter is the model name. 
The second parameter is an array of fields. 
If you don't want to filter a particular field pass null in that spot.

-Option 2: Manually
	<?php echo $form->create('Post', array('action' => 'index', 'id' => 'filters')); ?>
	<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
		<thead>
			<tr>
				<th><?php echo $this->Paginator->sort('Name', 'name', $filter_options);?></th>
				<th class="actions">Actions</th>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<th><?php echo $form->input('name'); ?></th>
				<th>
					<button type="submit" name="data[filter]" value="filter">Filter</button>
					<button type="submit" name="data[reset]" value="reset">Reset</button>
				</th>
			</tr>
		</thead>
		<tbody>
			// loop through and display your data
		</tbody>
	</table>
	<?php echo $form->end(); ?>
	<div class="paging">
		<?php echo $this->Paginator->prev('<< '.__('previous', true), $filter_options, null, array('class' => 'disabled'));?>
		<?php echo $this->Paginator->numbers($filter_options);?>
		<?php echo $this->Paginator->next(__('next', true).' >>', $filter_options, null, array('class' =>' disabled'));?>
	</div>
	
4. Add Behavior to model (only necessary for HABTM and HasMany):
	var $actsAs = 'Filter';

At this point, everything should theoretically work.

For action(s) other than index, add a line to the controller such as this:
	$this->Filter->initialize($this, array('actions' => 'admin_index'));

To set it up for redirecting to the url with filters in it (which defaults to off), add a line to the controller such as this:
	$this->Filter->initialize($this, array('redirect' => true));

To set it up to include time in the filter, add a line to the controller such as this:
	$this->Filter->initialize($this, array('useTime' => true));

These different initialize options can be combined in the array.

## TODO:
<<<<<<< HEAD
1. Better code commenting - Done, left to help enforce the habit
2. Support Datetime - Mostly Done
3. Support URL redirects and parsing - Mostly Done
4. Refactor datetime filtering for ranges
5. Allow the action to be configurable
6. Support jQuery Datepicker
