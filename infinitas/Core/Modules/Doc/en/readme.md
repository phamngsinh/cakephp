Modules provide a way for you to add blocks of content in specific places on your Website. There are a number of ways Modules can be included and configured depending on your specific requirements.
Modules are specific to a Users, so you can not load Modules designed for the admin section of the site into the front-end.


There are a few sections that are closely linked to Modules within Infinitas:

- Routes define where modules are loaded

- Users define what modules are shown depending on who is viewing the site

- Themes define where modules are placed on the site
