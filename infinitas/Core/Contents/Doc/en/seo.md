When the Contents plugin is used to build content it automatically tracks a number of things related to SEO. This can be helpful in identifying a number of common pitfalls when writing content on public facing sites where getting to the top of the SERP's is key.

> This functionality has no use for sites that are not serving publicly available content.

##### Spotting errors

From the [contents dashboard](/admin/contents) you can access a page that [lists all](/admin/contents/content\_issues) content by the number of errors it has. You can see at a glance what the content is and how many possible errors there are.
