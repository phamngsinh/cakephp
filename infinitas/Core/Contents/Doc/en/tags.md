The Contents plugin has an adapted version of the [CakeDC tags plugin](https://github.com/CakeDC/tags). This includes a number of changes such as integration with the admin backed so that it fits with the rest of the design, along with a lot of other changes to make useage much more simple.

Some fields have also been added to the tags so that more information can be stored and displayed that is related to the tags. An example of this can be seen below.

> The added details can be used as headers for lookups on a specific tag. This can also be used to build a [glossary](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary) for your tags.

Tags can be attached to any data and are automatically attached to data that makes use of the contents plugin such as the Blog and Cms plugins.

The Contents plugin also comes with a tag cloud module that can be displayed anywhere on the site through the Modules plugin.
