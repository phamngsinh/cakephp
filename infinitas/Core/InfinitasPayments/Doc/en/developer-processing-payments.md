InfinitasPayments is a unified interface to payment gateway integration. It is an abstracted interface that collects all the data required for processing a payment and can use virtually any configured payment gateway.

There are two main methods of collecting money from users, either through an API or using forms. The InfinitasPayments plugin can process payments through both methods.

Some payment gateways, especially through API access provide ways to process payments without the user and sometimes allow batch processing for more than one order or invoice at a time.
