The Infinitas repository contains a submodule that points to the correct version of CakePHP. If you are using git for your development you should not need to download or configure CakePHP besides initialising the submodules. The details below are for more advanced users that do not wish to use the included CakePHP submodule.

You can obtain the CakePHP code from a number of locations including the following:

- git repo: `git://github.com/cakephp/cakephp.git`
- [zip download](https://github.com/cakephp/cakephp/zipball/master)
- [tar.gz download](https://github.com/cakephp/cakephp/tarball/master)

Git is by far the most prefered method as you are sure to have the latest upto date code. With the speed that opensource progresses other methods such as `apt-get`, PHP's `PEAR` and others are not recomended as they are almost always outdated. This will mean that you end up with a copy that may have bugs and security issues that have aleady been fixed in later versions.

### Preface

It is best to keep your copy of CakePHP in `shared location` so that you will be able to use the same copy for multiple applications. This guide will use `/var/www/frameworks/cakephp` as that location.

To make this copy of CakePHP available without having to modify every single app we can make a small addition to the `php.ini` file that tells PHP where it can find Cake. Here we will assume you are using `PHP FPM` to serve request, although this could be something else like `cgi` or `apache`.

	sudo nano /etc/php5/fpm/php.ini

You will look for the include configuration, `ctrl + w` will give a search option in `nano`. Other editors my use `ctrl + f` or similar. The text to search for is `include_path`. Once found you will want to adjust the path so that is resembles the following:

	include\_path = "/usr/share/php:/var/www/frameworks/cakephp/lib"

If you have other include paths make sure to leave them in tact. The above line shows an include for two locations, the first is php shared libs from `PEAR` and the second is our `CakePHP` inlcude path.

### Install with Git

If you do not already have a copy of CakePHP you will need to clone a copy. In terminal change to the `/var/www` folder

	cd /var/www

You can then clone CakePHP with the above url into our shared location:

	git clone git://github.com/cakephp/cakephp.git frameworks/cakephp

Make sure you are on the correct `branch` by changing to the newly created dir

	cd frameworks/cakephp

and then `checking` it out. The current version in use is `2.3`

	git checkout 2.3

### Install with download

**This option is not recomended as it makes obtaining updates more difficult.**

Change to the `/var/www` folder

	cd /var/www

You will need to create the folder for CakePHP to go into.

	mkdir frameworks && mkdir frameworks/cakephp

You can then change to the newly created folder

	cd frameworks/cakephp

To download a copy of the CakePHP framework you can use wget with one of the urls from above. For a `zip` file you can use the following

	wget -O cakephp.zip https://github.com/cakephp/cakephp/zipball/master

For a `tar.gz` file use the following

	wget -O cakephp.tar.gz https://github.com/cakephp/cakephp/tarball/master

Once you have a copy of the code you will need to extract it. You can do that with the following command depending on what you have downloaded

For the `zip` file use:

	unzip cakephp.zip

For the `tar.gz` file use:

	tar -zxvf cakephp.tar.gz

### System check

You should now have a copy of CakePHP that is ready to use for all your apps. Make sure that your webserver has permisson to use these files. Running the command `ls -al /var/www/frameworks/cakephp` you should see something like the following:

	drwxrwxr-x  8 www-data   www-data    4096 2012-09-17 17:38 .
	drwxrwxr-x  8 www-data   www-data    4096 2012-07-08 00:54 ..
	drwxrwxr-x 14 www-data   www-data    4096 2012-09-15 12:29 app
	-rw-rw-r--  1 www-data   www-data     177 2012-04-30 12:20 build.properties
	-rw-rw-r--  1 www-data   www-data    8647 2012-07-02 23:52 build.xml
