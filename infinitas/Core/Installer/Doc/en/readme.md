The Installer plugin handles the installation of additional plugins within Infinitas, while also providing shells for developers to create and update plugins. Installable code such as plugins and themes need to have a `release` created before they can be eaisly installed on other Infinitas applications. 

The `release` process allows the developer to specify what the plugin contains so that it is able to later install it, along with other information such as who the author is and where updates come from.
