The [user management dashboard](/admin/users) is the place to go when you need to create or modify users. The dashboard can also contain information such as a graph displaying the registrations per month over the last few months.

The dashboard provides links to user related sections of your site, including user groups, access control and visitors to your site.

Besides being able to manager the users and groups in the system, the Users plugin also manages authentication and access. Some of the data included in the users table includes `last\_click` which is the datetime the user was last recorded doing an action on the site. It also records the `last\_login` datetime which is when the user last logged into the application.

Other basic information such as the users `opperating system`, `browser` and `ip address` is recorded.
