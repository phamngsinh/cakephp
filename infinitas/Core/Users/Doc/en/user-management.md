To view and manage Users open up the [user managemen](/admin/users/users) as shown here. From the user manager you are able to create new users, edit existing users and also manage thier access to your site. You can also see at a quick glance what type of users have registered on your site, showing thier location (based off ip geo location) and the type of computer they use.

When you disable a user they will still be able to access your sites public pages. They will not be able to log in while in the disabled state. See the security section for information on totally blocking a user from the site

#### Editing users

You can edit a user by either clicking the `username` in the table, or checking the box next to the user and then clicking edit. A form similar to the one shown will be displayed with the users information already filled out. You can change the fields and click save to permanently change the details.

> Leaving the password field empty will not change a users password. You are only required to fill out the password field when changing it.

#### User groups

Groups are a way of organising users and forms part of the access control. Infinitas is installed by default with two groups, `admin` and `users`. There is a third pseudo group called `public` which refers to any user that is not logged into the site at all.

#### Logged in users

For sites that use the login system, you can quickly see who is currently logged into the site. This information excludes administrators and users that are not logged in.
