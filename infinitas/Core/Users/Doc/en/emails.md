There are a number of emails generated by the Users plugin. This plugin makes use of the Newsletter plugin for sending emails. The templates and newsletter content can be customised in the backend.

The emails make use of the same templating engine that is available to the frontend so you can insert dynamic content into emails.

### Registration

#### users-confirm-registration

If your site is configured to require email verification this email will be sent once the user has submitted the registration details. This email should contain a link back to the activation url so that the user can finalise registration.

If you want to manually activate users, this email could explain this process.

#### users-account-created

This is the welcome email sent to new users. If the site requires that a user validate the email it will be sent once validation has been completed, otherwise it is sent the moment the user registers on the site.

#### users-forgot-password

If the user has fogotten their password they submit the forgot password link and this email is sent, which contains a key in the url they need to visit.

#### users-account-created-admin

This is similar to the `users-account-created` email, except it is sent to site admins and contains more information about the newly registered user.
