The user profile page displays the users information and gives them a place to do general actions such as linking to social networking accounts or viewing general information on the site. It is possible to include data from other plugins through the use of Events.

Each plugin can display various pieces of information on the profile page through the event system. When making use of this disabling the plugin will not break your site, instead the information will simply not show any more.

### Examples

The Shop plugin contains events for data on the profile page already. Some of the data it displays includes latest orders, new products, viewed and so on.

Other examples include the Twitter and Facebook plugins which display information regarding any account linking.

See the docs for each plugin for more information on how they can be used to build profile pages.

> Profile pages by default are only available to the user. Bob can not view Sams profile page for example, and Bob would need to be logged into see his own profile data.
