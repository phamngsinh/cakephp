/**
 * Charts plugin events
 *
 * @section charts-overview What is it
 *
 * The Charts plugin is an abstraction of data that uses the Adapter
 * design pattern to draw the charts. This make it really simple to extend
 * and change. There are some core classes included for some types of charts
 * that you can use as is, or as a base to create your own.
 *
 * @section categories-usage How to use it
 *
 * To get started creating some charts you will need to include the Charts
 * helper in your code, this can be done by adding either of the following
 *
 * @code
 *  // could also be within another helper
 *	class MyController extends MyPluginAppController{
 *		public $helpers = array(
 *			// ...
 *			'Charts.Charts' => array(
 *				'MyPlugin.Example'
 *			)
 *			// ...
 *		)
 *	}
 *
 *	// or from within a controller method
 *
 *	$this->helpers['Charts.Charts'][] = 'MyPlugin.Example';
 * @endcode
 *
 * Both examples will look for and include a helper in the folder
 * plugins/my_plugin/views/helpers/example_chart_engine.php with and the class
 * should lool like this:
 *
 * @code
 *	class ExampleChartEngineHelper extends ChartsBaseEngineHelper{
 *		// ...
 *	}
 * @endcode
 *
 * After having done this you will be able to use the charts helper to start
 * building charts for what ever data you have. You also have the option of
 * making a certain chart globally available by including it with the Event
 * system.
 *
 * A basic example of creating a html chart will look something like below.
 * Note that this is almost the format that the charts engine produces, basically
 * it will shuffle things around to be more simple to manipulate and allows
 * for a few other options like passing size as '900,150' (a string) instead
 * of the array format. This is true for all options.
 *
 * @code
 *	echo $this->Charts->draw(
 *		'bar',
 *		array(
 *			'data' => array(10, 15, 20, 5, 10, 40),
 *			'axes' => array(
 *				'x' => array('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f'),
 *				'y' => ''
 *			),
 *			'size' => array(900, 150)
 *			'tooltip' => true
 *		)
 *	);
 * @endcode
 *
 * @section categories-code How it works
 *
 * When the charts helper is initialized it take the engine that you passed
 * and adds it to the helpers array. Pretty basic stuff, its just adding another
 * helper.
 *
 * When you call ChartsHelper::draw() with the params it will take all the
 * data passed and make sure its mostly valid and ready for the chart engine
 * to process. This makes it really simple to either switch the chart engine
 * at a later stage and develop new engines that can be used with ease.
 *
 * The Charts helper will also take care of caching so times when the data
 * has been cached there will be no calls to the actual engine drawing the
 * charts.
